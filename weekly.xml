    This file describes which devices are to be built weekly.

    These devices include legacy devices that use our add/remove options found in
    the manifest folder of the vendor_pac repo and low activity devices (less than 35 downloads per week).

    The will run once a week and that is it. This is to save needed resources.

    The "hasextras" variable is set to 1 if the device has adds/removes or extras,
    thereby triggering a resync of the build machine, source after the build of the weekly device.
